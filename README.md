Just trynna figure out an MR pipeline for selecting instrumental variables from GWAS catalog

---

#### **Step 1: Define the Research Question**
- Identify the exposure (\( X \)) and outcome (\( Y \)) of interest.
- Ensure the relationship between \( X \) and \( Y \) is biologically plausible.

---

#### **Step 2: Select Genetic Instruments**
1. **Identify Variants**:
   - Use GWAS summary statistics to find variants strongly associated with \( X \) (e.g., \( p < 5 \times 10^{-8} \)).
   - Check the strength of instruments using the F-statistic (\( F > 10 \)).
   
2. **Create Allele Scores**:
   - Combine multiple variants into an allele score:
     \[
     G_{\text{score}} = \sum w_i G_i
     \]
     where \( w_i \) are GWAS-derived weights for each variant.

3. **Colocalization Check**:
   - Ensure the selected variants affect both \( X \) and \( Y \) through the same biological pathway.

---

#### **Step 3: Address Potential Biases**
1. **Avoid Sample Overlap**:
   - Use independent datasets for \( X \) and \( Y \) when possible.
   
2. **Correct for Winner’s Curse**:
   - Use unbiased effect sizes by leveraging replication studies or adjusted estimates.

3. **Account for Weak Instruments**:
   - Ensure the instruments explain a significant proportion of \( X \).

4. **Mitigate Collider/Selection Bias**:
   - Avoid conditioning on variables affected by both \( X \) and \( Y \), such as using non-representative case-control samples.

---

#### **Step 4: Choose and Implement an IV Method**
1. **Basic Analysis (IVW)**:
   - Perform a weighted regression using all genetic variants:
     \[
     \beta_{\text{IVW}} = \frac{\sum w_i \beta_{XG_i} \beta_{YG_i}}{\sum w_i \beta_{XG_i}^2}
     \]
     - \( \beta_{XG_i} \): Effect of \( G_i \) on \( X \).
     - \( \beta_{YG_i} \): Effect of \( G_i \) on \( Y \).
     - \( w_i \): Variance weights from \( \beta_{XG_i} \).

2. **Advanced Sensitivity Analyses**:
   - **MR-Egger**: Adjust for pleiotropy by allowing the intercept to vary.
   - **Weighted Median**: Use the median of the ratio estimates to reduce the influence of outliers.
   - **Multivariable MR**: Include additional covariates (e.g., confounders) directly in the model.

---

#### **Step 5: Handle Binary Outcomes or Exposures**
1. Use logistic regression for binary outcomes:
   \[
   \text{logit}(P(Y=1)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \eta
   \]
2. Interpret results carefully, accounting for non-collapsibility of Odds Ratios.

---

#### **Step 6: Test for Heterogeneity and Pleiotropy**
1. **Heterogeneity Testing**:
   - Use Cochran’s \( Q \)-test to check for inconsistent effects across variants.
   
2. **Pleiotropy Testing**:
   - Check if variants affect \( Y \) independently of \( X \) using MR-Egger’s intercept.

---

#### **Step 7: Assess Power**
1. Calculate sample size requirements using:
   \[
   \text{Power} \propto n \cdot \frac{\text{Variance explained by instruments}}{\sigma^2}
   \]
   Ensure enough sample size to detect small effects.

---

#### **Step 8: Interpret Results**
1. Confirm consistency across methods (e.g., IVW, MR-Egger).
2. Examine sensitivity analyses for robustness.
3. Ensure the causal estimate aligns with biological and epidemiological evidence.

---

### **Final Thoughts**
For GWAS-sized datasets:
- Start with **IVW regression** for its efficiency and robustness.
- Use advanced methods like **MR-Egger** or **Weighted Median** for sensitivity checks.
- Follow strict steps to mitigate biases, test instrument validity, and ensure colocalization.
